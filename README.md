# asteroids-js

## This is a JavaScript version of the 1979 multi-directional arcade shooting game "Asteroids" released by ATARI back in 1979

This project is built on its entirety with vanilla JavaScript. The game is capable of:

* Spawning a triangular ship , movable by the three arrow keys (left to rotate left, right to rotate right, and up to accelerate).
* Spawn moving asteroids at random areas.
* Any shot/ship/asteroids passing the canvas will be spawned at opposite side. 
* Use the space bar to shoot asteroids. On impact player gains points depending on size of asteroids shot (The smaller the more points).
* Keep track of score and high score.
* Start with three lives, lose each one upon impact with an asteroid. Impacted asteroids will be destroyed. Loss of all lives results in "Game Over".
* Blink at spawn (New Game/After loss of life). At this state player is invincible/impervious to any asteroid impacts.
* Level Up = faster and more asteroids.
